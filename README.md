# Abstract data structures

This project shows examples of implementation of some abstract data structures in *C++11*. 

### Heap

A heap is tree-based data structure [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)](). Current implementation is generic with a constructor taking only maximum size of a container as an argument:

`Heap<T>(size_t maxSize)`

`push(T)`
